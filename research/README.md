## Brief Overview

For decades digitizing the shipping document industry has been faught with technical and legal difficulties. There is no true electronic replacement for the bill of lading, the principle shipping document used for any sort of commerical transport of goods. Combined with the legal difficulties of cross-border issues with laws, creating a solution has been considered the holy grail of the logistics industry. Few solutions have been close to providing an actual viable solution.

In creating a solution to this problem, Freight Trust establishes not only the technical software needed but also a legal framework in which 100% of B2B shippments can be done under the Freight Trust framework.

By dividing the necessary constituant parts into seperate layers, Freight Trust enables a truely global platform for any trading partner to leverage

Layer0: Legal 
Layer1: Bill of Lading/Documents
Layer2: Add-On Contracts, e.g. Forward Contracts

### Lex Regime
Legal issues are the principle issue at heart of solving the digital bill of lading issue. By leveraging an approach of modeling Freight Trust after existing Capital/Financial Institutions like DCOs or DCMs, we follow a robust system of trans-national traditions and agreements in dealing with the principle issue of liability in relation to 3rd parties (i.e. Insurance Companies/Default or Bankruptcy) of trading partners.
